This is the test server. Since broadcastify has not responded,
this was made so that we can test the pipeline.

To try this out:
Run the python file (Terminal: python main.py)
Then send a random request to the server to start.

I normally just open a different terminal and type:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/process_and_post -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}'

Then simply speak into the mic, it should send the audio data into the
main heimdall server (make sure the other server is actually hosted first).
